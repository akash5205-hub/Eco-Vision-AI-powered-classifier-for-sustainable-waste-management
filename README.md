Eco Vision is an AI-based system that classifies waste into categories like plastic, paper, metal, glass, and organic using computer vision.
It promotes sustainable waste management and can be integrated with IoT smart bins for real-time segregation.

Features
*🧠 AI waste classification using deep learning
*☁️ IBM Cloud / Node-RED integration for data storage and visualization
*🔗 IoT-enabled smart bin compatibility (ESP32 + Camera)
*📊 Dashboard insights for waste statistics
Tech Stack
*Python · TensorFlow / Keras · OpenCV · IBM Cloud · Node-RED · (optional) ESP32 + Camera

How It Works
1️⃣ Capture or upload an image of waste
2️⃣ The trained AI model identifies the waste type
3️⃣ Classification results are sent to the cloud for storage and display
4️⃣ (Optional) Smart bin mechanism sorts waste automatically

🌱 Impact
*Encourages recycling and sustainability
*Reduces manual waste sorting
*Supports smart city and green initiatives

Future Scope
🔹 Real-time multi-bin monitoring
🔹 Voice or LED feedback for waste type
🔹 Improved dataset for higher accuracy
